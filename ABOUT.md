# 1.6-rebuild

## What is 1.6-rebuild?
1.6-rebuild is a continuation of Vector firmware 1.6, 1.6 is considered to be the best Vector firmware version because it's the last version made by anki and has a higher activity level compared to other later firmware versions. However it isn't perfect, with 1.6 being older it has more bugs compared to newer firmwares and is missing out on some features. This is where I came in, since late July of 2025 I've been working on porting features from newer Vector firmwares such as 1.8's custom eye colors and 2.0's Vector 2.0 support over to 1.6 while making sure to keep the charm of 1.6.

## Sounds great, what are the changes you've made?
You can find all the changes I've made over in [CHANGES.md](/CHANGES.md)

## How can I install it?
1.6-rebuild is installable via froggitti's web setup at [https://websetup.froggitti.net/](https://websetup.froggitti.net/). Steps are as follows:

0. - (Optional) Unlock your robot via [https://unlock-prod.froggitti.net/](https://unlock-prod.froggitti.net/). (You can skip this if you've already unlocked or would prefer not to unlock your robot)

1. - Put your robot into recovery mode by putting Vector on the charger and holding the backpack button until Vector's lights turn back on. (You'll know Vector is in recovery when you see anki.com/v, ddl.io/v, anki.com/dev or u.p-2.xyz on Vector's screen)

2. - Go to [https://websetup.froggitti.net/](https://websetup.froggitti.net/) and select the option that says "CUSTOM FIRMWARE" in the stack. (Note for prod users, use [https://anki2.ca/1.6-prod/](https://anki2.ca/1.6-prod/) to install the ota)

7. - Let it install and wait for Vector to reboot, once you see the V boot anim you know Vector is on 1.6-rebuild
